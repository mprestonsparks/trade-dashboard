## Deployment Strategy
**Local/Staging:**
- Use Docker Compose to run Redis, RabbitMQ, Postgres, and all three microservices plus the frontend.
- Ideal for development and testing new configurations and strategies.
**Production:**
- Consider Kubernetes for advanced scaling, health checks, and rolling updates.
- Use managed Redis and RabbitMQ services if possible.
- Scale Trade Discovery and Market Analysis horizontally based on load.
- Frontend served by a CDN for low latency.
**Secrets & Config:**
- Store secrets (DB password, API keys) in environment variables or a secrets manager (Vault, K8s Secrets).
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) can build Docker images, run tests, and deploy automatically.
**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Integrate logging and metrics tools (Prometheus, ELK stack) to track performance, market state transitions, and trade outcomes.
- Monitor GA convergence, Active Inference adaptation speed, and the frequency of state changes to tune parameters over time.
