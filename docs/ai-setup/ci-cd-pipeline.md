## CI/CD Pipeline
**Continuous Integration:**
- Trigger on pull requests.
- Steps:
  - Lint code (e.g., `black` for Python, ESLint for frontend).
  - Run unit tests (pytest for backend services, Jest for frontend).
  - Build Docker images and run integration tests if feasible.
**Continuous Deployment:**
- Trigger on merges to main.
- Steps:
  - Push built images to a container registry.
  - Deploy to staging environment (Docker Compose or K8s).
  - Run smoke tests to ensure services respond as expected.
  - If stable, promote to production.
**Testing and Validation:**
- Unit tests for PCA routines, GA optimization steps, Active Inference belief updates.
- Integration tests for API endpoints, data flow, and message passing via RabbitMQ.
- UI tests for checking parameter configuration forms and data visualization.
A robust CI/CD pipeline ensures that as the services evolve, the system remains stable, configurable, and continuously improves the quality of trading decisions.
